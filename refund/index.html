  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [DATE]</p>

  <p>GuildPass is billed as a recurring subscription through Stripe. We want you to be satisfied with the Service and will work with you in good faith if there are issues.</p>

  <h2>1. Subscription Billing</h2>

  <p>Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period until canceled. You can cancel at any time, and your subscription will remain active until the end of the current period.</p>

  <h2>2. Refunds</h2>

  <p>We may offer refunds on a case-by-case basis, particularly in situations where:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is a technical issue with GuildPass preventing normal operation, and we are unable to resolve it in a reasonable timeframe.</li>
    <li>You were charged in error or charged after you canceled your subscription.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Refunds are not guaranteed and may be declined if the Service has been used as expected during the billing period.</p>

  <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>

  <p>If you believe a refund is warranted, contact us at [your email] with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The email address associated with your subscription</li>
    <li>The date and amount of the charge</li>
    <li>A brief explanation of the issue</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will review your request and respond in a reasonable time frame.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Fees</h2>

  <p>We are not responsible for fees charged by your bank, card issuer, or payment provider (such as currency conversion fees or overdraft charges).</p>
