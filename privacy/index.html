  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [DATE]</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how GuildPass (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our website and Service.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Discord data:</strong> Discord user IDs, server (guild) IDs, and role IDs that you choose to manage through GuildPass.</li>
    <li><strong>Stripe data:</strong> Stripe customer IDs, subscription IDs, and related metadata necessary to determine subscription status. We do not store full payment card numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Account &amp; contact info:</strong> If you contact us or create an account, we may store your email address and messages.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Basic logs (timestamps, IP addresses, and request metadata) used for security, debugging, and improving the Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>To provide and operate the GuildPass Service.</li>
    <li>To determine which Discord members should receive or lose specific roles based on subscription status.</li>
    <li>To maintain security, monitor abuse, and debug issues.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you about the Service, changes, and support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>

  <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>

  <p>We may share information with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> such as hosting providers, error tracking tools, and Stripe for payments.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal authorities:</strong> if required by law or to protect our rights, users, or the public.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

  <p>We retain data as long as necessary to provide the Service, meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you cancel your subscription, we may retain limited records (like logs and billing information) for legal and accounting purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>

  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>6. Children</h2>

  <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>7. International Users</h2>

  <p>If you access the Service from outside the United States, you understand that your data may be processed in the United States or other countries with different data protection laws.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>You can remove the bot from your Discord server at any time.</li>
    <li>You can cancel your GuildPass subscription at any time.</li>
    <li>You may contact us to request access, correction, or deletion of certain data, subject to legal and technical limitations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the new Policy.</p>
