  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [DATE]</p>

  <p>Welcome to GuildPass (“we”, “us”, “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the GuildPass website, application, and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By using GuildPass, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>

  <p>GuildPass connects Discord servers with Stripe billing data to automate Discord role access based on subscription status. When configured correctly, active subscribers receive a role in your Discord server, and canceled or unpaid subscribers have that role removed.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

  <p>You must be at least 18 years old and able to form a binding contract to use the Service. By using GuildPass, you represent that you meet these requirements.</p>

  <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for the content and conduct in your Discord server(s).</li>
    <li>You are responsible for your Stripe account, including pricing, refunds, disputes, and tax obligations.</li>
    <li>You agree not to use GuildPass for illegal activities, harassment, hate, or any content that violates Discord’s or Stripe’s terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Subscriptions &amp; Billing</h2>

  <p>GuildPass is offered as a subscription service. Fees, billing intervals, and included features are described on our website or within the Service. Payments are processed by Stripe. By subscribing, you authorize recurring charges until you cancel.</p>

  <h2>5. Cancellations &amp; Termination</h2>

  <p>You may cancel your GuildPass subscription at any time through the billing portal or by contacting us. Upon cancellation, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period, after which your access may be limited and automated role management will stop.</p>

  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these Terms, misuse the Service, or engage in fraud or abuse.</p>

  <h2>6. No Guarantee of Results</h2>

  <p>GuildPass automates role changes based on data received from Stripe and Discord. We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation, perfect uptime, or that every role change will occur instantly. You are responsible for verifying that your roles and server configuration meet your needs.</p>

  <h2>7. Data &amp; Privacy</h2>

  <p>We collect and process limited data necessary to provide the Service, such as Discord IDs, Discord server IDs, role IDs you select, and Stripe customer and subscription identifiers. For more information, see our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>

  <p>GuildPass, including its design, code, and branding, is owned by [YOUR NAME OR COMPANY]. You may not copy, resell, or reverse engineer the Service.</p>

  <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

  <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the Service.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>

  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

  <h2>12. Contact</h2>

  <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, you can contact us at: [your email]</p>
